# TODO: Higher-Order Functions Within C++

## Description

For our project, we are going to be explaining what higher-order functions look like in C++. We will talk about how it hasn't been touched upon in previous classes and how CSCI 3155 helped us better understand the uses of higher-order functions. We will also talk about the benefits of using higher-order functions and how useful it is in C++. We will also provide examples of higher-order functions in C++.
## Repository Organization

The repository is organized quite simply. There are the submission requirements along with examples.cpp and prog. examples.cpp is the code that was compiled into the executable prog file. All one must do is run prog in the terminal to get the code to run. In order to edit and play with the code, one can edit examples.cpp and run ```compile w g++ -o prog examples.cpp```. One can run prog in the terminal using ```./prog```.

## Building and Testing Instructions

TODO: Replace with building and testing instructions. Please minimize the number of dependencies and as simple and platform-independent as possible. Consider, for example, using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).
