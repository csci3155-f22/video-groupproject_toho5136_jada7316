# TODO: Replace this with Your Project Title

## Description

For our project, we are going to be explaining what higher-order functions look like in C++. We will talk about how it hasn't been touched upon in previous classes and how CSCI 3155 helped us better understand the uses of higher-order functions. We will also talk about the benefits of using higher-order functions and how useful it is in C++. We will also provide examples of higher-order functions in C++.
## Repository Organization

We will have our script for the video placed in a markdown file called, "script.md". We will also have a .cpp file that will house the example codes and other materials that we will implement. Additionally, we will also upload our slides that we will use as a pdf.

## Building and Testing Instructions

TODO: Replace with building and testing instructions. Please minimize the number of dependencies and as simple and platform-independent as possible. Consider, for example, using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).
