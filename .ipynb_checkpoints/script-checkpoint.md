INTRODUCTION\
Person 1: Hello! My name is __ and I am working with my partner, __, to go over higher-order functions in C++.\
Person 2: So what are higher-order functions? Well, higher-order functions are functions that take in another function as an argument.\
Person 1: The functions that are taken in as an argument are known as callback functions.\
Person 2: Higher-order functions are an essential concept that everyone must know if you are going to enroll in CSCI 3155.\
Person 1: Higher-order functions are a category in a wider concept known as functional programming.\
Person 2: There is one thing that you must remember in order to succeed in CSCI 3155. That is that FUNCTIONS ARE VALUES!\
Person 1: Let's look at some examples that we have done in CSCI 3155.\
Person 2: As we can see, the function, 'foldLeftAndThen' takes in a tree, z of type A, a function that takes (A, Int) and returns A, and a success continuation that turns type A to type B.\
Person 1: 'foldLeftAndThen' is an example of a higher-order function.\
Person 2: Now that we know what higher-order functions are and what it looks like, we can discuss what higher-order functions are in C++.\
Person 1: So from what we know, we can not pass in functions as parameters in C++.\
Person 2: However, due to the flexibility of C++, we are able to still use other functions known as lambdas within the scope of the higher-order function without the need to pass it as a parameter.\
Person 1: Lambdas are short and simple unnamed functions that are used as inline code within a higher-order function.\
